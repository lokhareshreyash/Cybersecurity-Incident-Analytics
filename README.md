# Cybersecurity Incident Analytics Dashboard (2015–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Cybersecurity Incident Analytics Dashboard** designed to analyze global cybersecurity incidents across multiple dimensions including attack types, vulnerability categories, geographic distribution, financial impact, and incident resolution performance.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to understand **where incidents occur, how they happen, which vulnerabilities are most exploited, and their business impact**, supporting data-driven cybersecurity decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze cybersecurity incidents by **attack type, vulnerability type, and country**
- Identify **high-risk vulnerabilities** contributing to frequent incidents
- Measure **financial and operational impact** of cyber incidents
- Compare **incident trends across time**
- Support **risk prioritization and security investment decisions**

## 🔍 Key Insights & Analysis

- **Phishing is the most common attack type**, highlighting the importance of user awareness and identity protection.
- **Zero-day and social engineering vulnerabilities** account for a significant portion of incidents, indicating challenges in proactive defense.
- Certain industries experience **higher financial losses**, suggesting uneven cyber risk exposure across sectors.
- Incident resolution times vary by **security mechanism**, showing that advanced detection methods (e.g., AI-based systems) can reduce response time.
- Cyber incidents are **globally distributed**, reinforcing the need for consistent, worldwide security standards.
